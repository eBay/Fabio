## Changelog

### Unreleased

#### Improvements

 * Demo server supports HTTPS
 
   The `demo/server/server` now supports `https` and `wss` to test the 
   HTTPS upstream support. To run an HTTPS server run the following

   ```shell
   # generate some test certs
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/eBay/fabio
   build/issue-225-gen-cert.bash

   # build and run the demo server
   cd demo/server
   go build
   ./server -certFile ../cert/server/server-cert.pem -keyFile ../cert/server/server-key.pem -proto https -prefix "/foo tlsskipverify=true"
   ```
   
 * Add route options to UI
 
   The UI now shows the combined options from all targets for a route.

 * Add fabio logo to UI
 
   The Fabio logo is displayed on all UI pages.

### [v1.4.2](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/releases/tag/v1.4.2) - 10 Apr 2017

The vault tests do not yet pass with vault 0.7.0 and support for vault 0.7.0 has yet to be confirmed.
fabio is known to work with vault 0.6.4.

#### Features

 * [PR #257](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/pull/257), [Issue #181](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/issues/181): Add HTTPS Upstream Support

   Upstream servers can now be served via HTTPS. To enable this for a route add the `proto=https` option
   to the `urlprefix-` tag. The upstream certificate needs to be in the system certificate chain for the
   certificate validation to succeed. To disable certificate validation for upstream requests add the
   `tlsskipverify=true` option. Support for certificate stores for upstream servers may come at a later
   point.

   Thanks to @shadowfax-chc for providing this patch.

   See: https://github.com/eBay/fabio/wiki/Features#https-upstream-support

 * [PR #258](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/pull/258): Allow UI/API to be served over HTTPS

   The UI/API endpoint can now be served via HTTPS. To enable this configure the `ui.addr` property
   with a `cs=<cert store>` option like the `proxy.addr` listeners.

   Thanks to @shadowfax-chc for providing this patch.

#### Improvements

 * Upgrade to go1.8.1
 * Run tests with consul 0.8.0
 * Improve CHANGELOG

### [v1.4.1](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/releases/tag/v1.4.1) - 4 Apr 2017

#### Features

 * [Issue #80](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/issues/80): Add support for access logging

   fabio now supports configurable access logging. By default access logging is disabled and can
   be enabled with `log.access.target=stdout`. The default format is the
   [Common Log Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format) but can be changed
   to either the [Combined Log Format](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#combined)
   or a custom log format by setting `log.access.format`

   Thanks to @beyondblog for providing the initial patch.

   See: https://github.com/eBay/fabio/wiki/Features#access-logging

### [v1.4](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/releases/tag/v1.4) - 25 Mar 2017

#### Features

 * [Issue #1](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/issues/1), [Issue #179](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/issues/179): Add generic TCP Proxy support

   fabio now supports raw TCP proxying support by setting the `proto=tcp` option on the
   `urlprefix-` tag. The target needs to be the external port of the service, e.g.
   `urlprefix-:3306` for a MySQL proxy. fabio needs to have a TCP listener configured for
   that port through the `proxy.addr` option, e.g. `proxy.addr=:3306;proto=tcp`.

   The TCP proxy also supports TLS which is configured through the `cs=<cert store>`
   option like the HTTPS listeners.

 * [Issue #163](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/issues/163): Support glob host matching

   This patch adds support for glob host matching the hostname in routes like
   `urlprefix-*.foo.com/bar`.

#### Improvements

 * Upgrade to Go 1.8 and drop support for Go 1.7

 * [Issue #178](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/issues/178): Add tests and timeouts to TCP+SNI proxy

   Add full integration tests and support for read/write timeouts through the `rt=` and `wt=`
   options on the listener config for the TCP+SNI proxy. The initial implementation was only
   tested manually.

 * [Issue #248](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/issues/248): Start listener after routing table is initialized

   fabio now waits for the first routing table before serving requests. This should remove
   503s during restarts on heavily loaded sites.
